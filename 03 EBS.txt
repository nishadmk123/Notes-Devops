EBS: (Elastic Block Store)

Q.What is EBS (Elastic Block Store) in AWS?
Amazon EBS is a block storage service used with EC2 instances.
It provides persistent, high-performance storage that behaves like a virtual hard disk attached to a server.
Even if the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated, data in EBS remains safe (unless you delete the volume).

Q.Types of EBS Volumes
| Type            | Use Case         | Example                   |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| gp3 / gp2 (SSD) | General purpose  | Web servers, apps         |
| io1 / io2 (SSD) | High IOPS        | Databases (Oracle, MySQL) |
| st1 (HDD)       | Throughput heavy | Logs, big data            |
| sc1 (HDD)       | Cold storage     | Backup, archives          |

Q.Key Features of EBS (with definitions)
| Key Point          | Definition                                                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Persistent Storage | Data remains even if EC2 stops/terminates                 |
| Block Storage      | Works like a raw hard disk (not file storage like S3/EFS) |
| AZ Specific        | Volume lives in one Availability Zone                     |
| Snapshots          | Backup of volume stored in S3                             |
| Resizable          | Increase size without downtime                            |
| Encryption         | Supports encryption at rest                               |
| High Performance   | SSD/HDD types based on need                               |
| Detach/Attach      | Can move volume to another EC2                            |
| Root Volume        | Used to install OS of EC2                                 |

Q.Your EC2 crashed but data is important. What will you do?
Detach the EBS volume from the crashed EC2 and attach it to a new EC2 instance. Mount the volume and recover the data.

Q.How do you take backup of EBS?
By creating EBS Snapshots. Snapshots are stored in S3 and can be used to recreate volumes.

Q.EBS volume is full. How to increase size without downtime?
Modify the EBS volume size from AWS console → then extend filesystem using resize2fs or xfs_growfs in Linux.

Q.How encryption works in EBS?
EBS supports encryption using AWS KMS. Data at rest, in transit, and snapshots are encrypted.

Q.What is root volume in EC2?
The EBS volume where the OS of EC2 is installed.

Q.One-Line Definitions (Quick Revision)

EBS: Persistent block storage for EC2.
Snapshot: Backup of EBS stored in S3.
IOPS: Input/Output operations per second.
Root Volume: OS disk of EC2.
Multi-Attach: One EBS to multiple EC2 (io1/io2 only).
gp3: Best general purpose SSD.
AZ Specific: EBS lives in one AZ.

Q.Why EBS and not S3?
“EBS is block storage used as a disk for EC2, whereas S3 is object storage accessed via API/HTTP.”
