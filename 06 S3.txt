S3: (Simple storage Service)

Q.What is Amazon S3?
Amazon S3 is object storage in AWS used to store files as objects in buckets
ex. Images, videos, backups, logs, PDFs, static websites, datasets, etc.

Use Amazon S3 when:
Storing backups
Hosting static website
Storing logs
Storing images/videos
Data lake / archive

Use Amazon EBS when:
Installing Linux/Windows OS
Running database (MySQL, Oracle)
Application files needing fast disk

You launch an EC2 server:
OS installed on EBS
Application logs pushed to S3
Daily DB backup stored in S3
Application running from EBS

S3 = Store files
EBS = Server disk

Q.S3 Lifecycle Policy (Automatic Cost Optimization)
In Amazon S3, a Lifecycle Policy automatically moves objects between storage classes based on age and can also delete them after a time.

| Storage Class        | Access Speed  | Cost     | Use Case              |
| -------------------- | ------------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| Standard             | Milliseconds  | High     | Active data           |
| Standard-IA          | Milliseconds  | Medium   | Rare access           |
| One Zone-IA          | Milliseconds  | Low      | Re-creatable data     |
| Glacier Instant      | Milliseconds  | Lower    | Archive, instant need |
| Glacier Flexible     | Minutes–Hours | Very low | Old backups           |
| Glacier Deep Archive | 12+ hours     | Cheapest | Legal/archive         |

1) S3 Standard
For frequently accessed data
Low latency, high throughput
Used for active files, websites, apps
Examples:
Website images
Application files
Daily accessed logs

2) S3 Standard – Infrequent Access (IA)
Accessed rarely, but must be available quickly
Cheaper than Standard
Retrieval cost applies
Examples:
Monthly backups
Old reports

3) S3 One Zone – IA
Same as IA but stored in one AZ only
Even cheaper
Risk: if AZ fails, data lost
Examples:
Re-creatable backup
Temporary data

4) S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
Archive data, but need instant access when required
Very low storage cost
Examples:
Medical records
Old project data occasionally needed

5) S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
Very cheap archive
Retrieval takes minutes to hours
Examples:
5-year-old backups
Compliance data

6) S3 Glacier Deep Archive
Cheapest storage in S3
Retrieval takes hours (12+)
For data you almost never access
Examples:
7–10 year legal records

Q: Can I mount S3 as a disk like EBS?
A: No. S3 is object storage accessed via API/URL, not a filesystem disk.

Q: Which is cheaper for backup?
A: S3.

Q: Where is OS installed?
A: EBS.

Q: Logs are increasing daily and S3 bill is high. What will you do?
A: Configure S3 Lifecycle to transition old logs to IA/Glacier and expire after retention.

Q: Can Lifecycle move existing objects?
A: Yes.

Q: Can it work by folder?
A: Yes, using prefix (e.g., backup/, logs/).

Note -> Lifecycle = Move old data to cheaper storage automatically + delete when not needed

Pro Tip (Cost Saving)

Combine:
Lifecycle Policy
Proper storage class selection
Versioning (optional, for safety)
