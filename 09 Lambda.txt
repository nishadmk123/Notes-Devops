Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services that lets you run code without managing servers.
It is event driven

1️⃣ You Write Code
Supported runtimes:
Python
Node.js
Java
Go
.NET
Custom runtime
2️⃣ You Upload to Lambda
3️⃣ Trigger Happens
Triggers can be
Amazon S3 (file upload)
Amazon API Gateway (HTTP request)
Amazon DynamoDB (data change)
Amazon EventBridge (scheduled job)
Amazon SNS (message)
Amazon SQS (queue message)
4️⃣ Lambda Runs in a Container
Internally:
AWS creates a lightweight container
Allocates memory
Executes your function
Destroys or reuses container

Q.What is Cold Start?

Cold start happens when:
No container is available
AWS creates new runtime environment
Cold start delay:
100ms – few seconds
Java & .NET usually slower
VPC-enabled Lambdas slower (ENI creation)
Solution:
Provisioned concurrency
Keep function warm

Note: 
1. Allocates memory (128 MB to 10 GB)
2. Max execution time: 15 minutes
3. Zip upload: 50 MB (direct), 250 MB (unzipped), Container image: 10 GB

Q.What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs event-driven code without provisioning or managing servers. 
It automatically scales and charges per execution time.

Q.What are its limitations?
It has a 15-minute execution limit, cold start latency, stateless nature, limited environment control, concurrency limits, 
and can become costly for continuous workloads.
