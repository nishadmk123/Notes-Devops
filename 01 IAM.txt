IAM: (Amazon Machine Image)

Q.What is IAM (Identity and Access Management)?
It controles who can access aws and what they are allowed to do.
It manages users, groups, roles, and permissions securely.
IAM ensures only authorized people or services can perform specific actions.

Q.Key Components of IAM
Users – Individual identities with login credentials.
Groups – Collection of users with shared permissions.
Roles – Temporary access granted to users or services.
Policies – JSON documents that define permissions.

Q.What is the difference between Role and User?
A User has permanent credentials (username/password or access keys).
A Role provides temporary credentials and is assumed when needed.
Roles are more secure for services like EC2.

What is an IAM Policy?
An IAM Policy is a permission document (JSON) that defines:
What actions are allowed or denied
On which resources
Under what conditions
this policy alone does nothing until attached to:
A User
A Group
A Role

Policy → Attached to Role → Role Attached to Service

Senario Based Ques & Ans.
=========================

Scenario: A new developer joins your team and needs access to S3 but not EC2. What will you do?
Answer: Create a user for the developer and attach a policy that allows only S3 access. Do not grant EC2 permissions. This follows least privilege. Add the user to a Developer group if needed.

Scenario: An EC2 instance needs permission to access an S3 bucket securely. What is the best practice?
Answer: Create an IAM Role with S3 access permissions. Attach the role to the EC2 instance. Avoid storing access keys inside the instance. Roles provide secure temporary credentials.

Scenario: You want all employees in the HR team to have the same access. How do you manage it?
Answer: Create an IAM group called HR. Attach required policies to the group. Add all HR users to that group. This makes permission management easy.

Scenario: A user should only view resources but not modify them. What type of access is needed?
Answer: Attach a Read-Only policy to the user or group. This allows viewing resources without making changes. It prevents accidental modifications.

Company A wants to allow Company B to access S3.
Solution:
Create a Role in Account A
Add trust policy allowing Account B
Attach S3 access policy to the role
Account B assumes the role
